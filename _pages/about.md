I am currently a second-year PhD student at University of Klagenfurt, Austria, under the supervision of Professor [Andrea M. Tonello](http://www.andreatonello.com/). Previously, I received my MSc and BSc degrees with honors from the University of Padova, Italy. I am interested in the design of objective functions for discriminative and generative models, with a particular focus on trustworthy AI and mutual information maximization.

I am currently a second-year PhD student at University of Klagenfurt, Austria. Previously, I received my MSc and BSc degrees with honors from the University of Padova, Italy. I am interested in the design of objective functions for discriminative and generative models, with a particular focus on mutual information maximization and communications engineering.
